<h1>Why I love pitbulls</h1>
<p>Pitbulls are one of the most known for fighting but are very loving.
They are also very kind to other people.Pitbulls are a very good pet to have because they can guard the house and be a great companion.
 Pitbulls can be protective but if trained right they can be taught to be nice but still protective.</p>
